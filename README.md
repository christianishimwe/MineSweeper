**General Overview **


Independently developed a Java-based version of the game Minesweeper, implementing recursive algorithms to reveal tiles and identify adjacent mines. 
Utilized arrays to manage the game board and inheritance to organize the codebase efficiently. Employed JUnit testing to ensure code functionality and reliability. 
This project enhanced my skills in Java programming, recursive algorithms, and software testing.
